# Sprint-17-Final-Project
Three portions, EDA, Model Building, and Solution Report of forecasting the churn of a telecom operators' clients,

## Final Project: Work Plan
You're going to have to preform an exploratory data analysis. At the end of Jupyter Notebook, write:

A list of clarifying questions
A rough plan for solving the task, specifying 3-5 basic steps and explaining each step in one or two sentences
The instructor will check your questions and work plan. The code will be reviewed by the instructor only if there are some areas of doubt.

## Final Project: Solution Code
Upload the code of your solution.

Here are some of the criteria used by the project instructors:

Have you performed all the steps?
Does the solution match the task condition?
Have you trained and tested the model correctly?
What is the quality score of the best model?
Have you kept to the project structure?
Have you kept the code neat?

## Final Project: Solution Report
Make a report at the end of the Jupyter Notebook with the solution. The instructor will check it. The code will be reviewed by the instructor only if there are some points of doubt.

In the report, please answer the following questions:

What steps of the plan were performed and what steps were skipped (explain why)?
What difficulties did you encounter and how did you manage to solve them?
What were some of the key steps to solving the task?
What is your final model and what quality score does it have?
Here are some of the criteria used by the instructor:

Did you answer all the questions?
Are the answers clear?
